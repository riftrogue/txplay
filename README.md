## Installation

### Quick Install (One-liner)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riftrogue/txplay/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Requirements

Install on Termux (Android):

```bash
pkg update
pkg install python mpv git
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riftrogue/txplay/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/riftrogue/txplay.git ~/.txplay
cd ~/.txplay

# Install dependencies
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt

# Install launcher
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cp txplay ~/.local/bin/txplay
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/txplay

# Add to PATH (if needed)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Requirements

- **Termux** (Android terminal emulator)
- Python 3.8+
- MPV media player
- Git

**Note:** This app is currently designed for Termux on Android. The music scanner is optimized for Android storage paths (`/sdcard/Music`).

## Usage

Launch the player:
```bash
txplay
```

### First Run Setup

1. Navigate to **Scan Options** from the home menu
2. Select your scan mode:
   - **Termux**: Scans `/sdcard/Music` (recommended)
   - **Phone**: Scans common Android music folders
   - **Custom**: Choose your own music directory

### Keyboard Controls

#### Global Controls
- **Arrow Keys** - Navigate menus
- **Enter** - Select/Play
- **q** - Quit or go back

#### Local Music Browser
- **Enter** - Play selected track
- **a** - Add track to queue
- **n** - Play next track in queue
- **s** - Stop playback
- **PgUp** - Seek backward 10 seconds
- **PgDn** - Seek forward 10 seconds

#### Player Status
The status bar at the top shows:
- Currently playing track
- Playback position and duration
- Queue count

## Updating

Re-run the installation command to update:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riftrogue/txplay/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer will automatically pull the latest changes.

## Uninstalling

```bash
txplay uninstall
```

This removes `~/.txplay` and `~/.local/bin/txplay` completely.

```

## Configuration

Config file location: `~/.txplay/txplay/data/config.json`

Example:
```json
{
  "scan_mode": "custom",
  "custom_scan_path": "/sdcard/Music"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found: txplay

Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH:
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### MPV not playing audio

Test MPV directly:
```bash
mpv --no-video /sdcard/Music/song.mp3
```

If MPV doesn't work, reinstall it:
```bash
pkg reinstall mpv
```

### No music files found

1. Check your scan path in Scan Options
2. Ensure music files exist in `/sdcard/Music` or your custom directory
3. Supported formats: mp3, m4a, flac, wav, ogg, opus
4. Grant Termux storage permission: `termux-setup-storage`
